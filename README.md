# About SELFDISCORD

selfdiscord is a set of methods for working with the discord api using your own account token (not a bot).
**selfboting is officially banned by T.O.S discord,** but nobody cares about that. Have you seen thousands of users with animated statuses? Welcome to the world of illegal botting

> **from developer:**    
in two entries and exits from any guild in a short period of time - your account will be disabled.

## How to start

Download `selfdiscord.py` and move it to your project folder, then just add the file to your script with `import selfdiscord`

## Fast start

```
import selfdiscord

client = selfdiscord.Client("mfa.token") # Ur discord token here

guilds = client.get_guilds() # Return list guilds
print(guilds) # Print dict
print(guilds[0]["name"]) # Return a guild name at first position (https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/guild#guild-object)
```
